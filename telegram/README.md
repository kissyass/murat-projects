# Telegram Group Members Fetcher

This program uses the Telethon API to log into your Telegram account and fetch members from a specific Telegram group. It works seamlessly if you are already a member of the group and the members are publicly visible. If the group hides member information, you must be an admin to retrieve the member list.

## Features

- **Telegram Login:** Authenticate using Telethon with your Telegram API credentials.
- **Group Member Extraction:** Fetch member details from a Telegram group.
- **Visibility Check:** Automatically checks if members are visible; if not, requires admin privileges.
- **Easy Integration:** Can be further extended to export or process fetched member data as needed.
